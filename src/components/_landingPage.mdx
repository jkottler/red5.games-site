# Welcome to Red5 Games
## Who We Are
Red5 is a father-son design team from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

We have been playing tabletop RPGs and other games for over sixty combined years.

Our discussions and explorations of existing games led us to design our own.

## Our Point of View
We believe that the unique strengths of tabletop games come from interactions, collaborations, and synergies found only between humans. Our games are designed to create or inspire narrative - a principle we term **Storiented**.

Every Red5 game is designed to be Storiented - to provide all players with tools and processes that create story live, at the table.

## Our Projects
Red5 has several projects underway - ranging from a card-driven wargame to an epic, multigeneral, tabletop roleplaying campaign.

### At the Walls of Troy
This quick card game allows you to play out the most famous war of all time - the Trojan War - in just a few minutes at your table.

Struggle in the three battlefields of the Iliad: the shore, the plains, and before the walls of Troy themselves. Use the subtle powers of the shared core deck and the particular strengths of each side's heroic deck to claim victory for either the Greeks or the Trojans.

### Raptor World
Play a pack of Velociraptor in this zero-prep, single-session, GM-less game of struggling to communicate and struggling to survive.

Escape the volcano-threatened research compound to safety in another part of the island using unique card-based minigames that allow the raptors to coordinate their actions and function as a pack.

### One Thousand Spears
One Thousand Spears is a multigenerational roleplaying campaign about an exodus across hostile lands. Imagine *Battlestar Galactica* set in the Bronze Age Collapse. 

You will play both young heroes and wise elders as you try to keep your people alive and your culture intact across up to seven generations as you flee the calamity that destroyed your city-state and try to reach the ancient homeland of your people, a place now known only in legend.

You will have to manage your political influence and the resources of your family as closesly as you manage your hero's health, and somehow find a balance between the impossible demands of your people, your family, and your personal glory.
